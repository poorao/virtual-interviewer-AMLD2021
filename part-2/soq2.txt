Tell me something about yourself? 
Do you consider yourself successful? Why?
How would you be an asset to this organisation?
What do you do when your schedule is interrupted?
How do you balance life and work?
Why will you resign from a job?
What situations make you angry?
How will you perform under pressure? Will it affect your performance?
What do you do if you disagree with your boss?
If you could relive the last 10 years of your life, what would you do differently?
What do people most often criticize about you?
Do you regret any decision in your life?
