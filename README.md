# Virtual Interviewer: Build your own interviewing agent ðŸ¤– :robot:
This repo contains all the resources required for the AMLD 2021 workshop - Virtual Interviewer: Build your own interviewing agent.

The goal of this workshop is to build a virtual interviewing agent capable of asking dynamic follow-up questions. 

This workshop will be conducted in two parts. In the first part, we will see how to build a follow-up question generation model using pre-trained GPT-2 language model. In the second part, we will see a demo of deploying the built model as a virtual agent using AWS Sumerian.

## Part 1
Follow along with the workshop using the colab notebook

## Part 2
This will be a walk through of setting things up on AWS Sumerian to create a virtual agent with capabilities of interviewing and follow-up questioning. We will use the model trained in the Part 1.
